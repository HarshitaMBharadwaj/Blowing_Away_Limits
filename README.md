# Wind Energy Project Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize key metrics related to wind energy production across U.S. states. The focus includes variables such as installed capacity, homes powered, investment, online projects, and the number of wind turbines.

## Dataset Information
- Date of Acquisition: November 15, 2023
- Original Data Source: American Wind Energy Association (AWEA)
- Variables: Ranking, State, Installed Capacity (MW), Equivalent Homes Powered, Total Investment ($ Millions), Wind Projects Online, # of Wind Turbines

## Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Explored data using functions like View, head, tail, summary, and glimpse.
- Checked variable types using typeof and glimpse.
- Identified and addressed missing values in columns.

## Data Cleaning and Standardization
- Renamed columns using clean_names for code-friendly variable names.
- Converted non-numeric data types to numeric.
- Created new variables for capacity per dollar invested and capacity per home powered.

## Data Summarization
- Computed summary statistics for installed capacity, total investment, homes powered, capacity per dollar, and capacity per home.

## Data Visualization
- Explored relationships through scatter plots, bar charts, and lollipop charts.
- Created a bar chart to highlight U.S. states' installed capacity.
- Developed a map visualization depicting installed capacity across states.
- Visualized leadership in investment per megawatt using a lollipop chart.
- Presented the number of wind projects online by state using a bar chart.

## Key Findings
- Texas leads in installed capacity, indicating its dominance in wind energy production.
- Investment per megawatt reveals economic efficiency, with some states excelling in optimizing investment.
- Number of online wind projects highlights Texas's significant contribution, emphasizing its leadership role.

## Conclusion
The project involves the analysis of wind energy data, exploring relationships, cleaning and standardizing data, summarizing key metrics, and creating insightful visualizations.
